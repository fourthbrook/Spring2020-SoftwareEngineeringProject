To deploy one must download the source code.

And download npm

In an IDE(I used vscode) open up a terminal and run the command 'npm install --save'

Then run the command 'npm start -- --reset-cache / npm start / react-native start '

Finally with an android virtual machine or android device plugged into your computer run the command 'npx react-native run-android'
